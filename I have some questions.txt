I have some questions for the hiring manager. Please forward them with an ETA of when they will respond.
Is the software version currently integrated with other functions such as the bank, holding accounts, trust accounts, G/L and/or A/R? To rephrase it, if you put or take something in one accounting or financial system do you have to re-enter it again in another aside from the redundancies necessary for auditing? I am trying to get an idea of how reconciliation is done.
Are there any recent organizational changes with respect to COVID and how is the organization or franchise set up?
How many different states/provinces will I be working with? 
How long ago did you update the job description, has there been other names for this position and what is the timeline?
